h1. Main

Like the name suggests jsMyAdmin  is similar to "phpMyAdmin".
It's primary prupose is to access, maintain and manage databases and their respective contents.
Unlike phpMyAdmin, jsMyAdmin is heavily based on javaScript (hence the name jsMyAdmin), in particular the jQuery framwork, to provide a very modern and comfortable interface for the user.

It is not meant to replace phpMyAdmin, but more of,  to be a very stylish and modern alternative to it - with, hopefully in the future quite some handy functions you won't find in PMA. 

h1. Features

* AJAX ( & jQuery) driven database access similar to phpMyAdmin

* HTML 5 capable browser

h1. Status

Still in (very) early developement phase, basic database access and table operations are working already.
First UI draft is completed.
